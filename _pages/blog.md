Follow my [blog](https://baldassareclimate.substack.com/) for an optimistic take on recent climate change news and research. 
I started this blog in July, 2024 to share my somewhat uncommon perspective that climate progress is actually going surprisingly well. 
While climate impacts become increasingly devastating, technological and social progress on decreasing emissions continues to outperform forecasts. 
Leveraging emerging technology and public support creates the potential to massively decrease emissions and change the future. 
Check out the [blog](https://baldassareclimate.substack.com/) and stay positive!
