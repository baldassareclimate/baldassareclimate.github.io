I am a Climate Scientist and Climate Adaptation Consultant. I earned a PhD in Atmospheric Science from the University of Utah, with research on improving climate change forecasts to be more precise. I use climate modeling to help government agencies and nonprofits ensure projects are resilient to climate change while navigating complex planning requirements including the new NEPA climate analysis. I also advise businesses on climate science and climate modeling opportunities.

**My Research**

My research uses atmospheric science, physics, machine learning, and economics to create better climate forecasts. As climate impacts become more severe, accurate and narrow projections are needed to improve resilience, which remains difficult with current climate modeling tools. While the ultimate solution is an overhaul of climate models, in my [publications](https://baldassareclimate.com/publications) I show that a simpler fix exists in the meantime, using economic forecasts and satellite data to remove less reliable projections from the more than 200 available simulations, allowing adaptation planners to focus on a much narrower range of possible climate changes.

**Consulting Services**

As a Climate Scientist, I can assist on a variety of projects where climate forecasts are necessary, assisting with greenhouse gas accounting, sustainability, or other climate-related issues. In the past, I worked on a few large forest restoration projects such as the [North Fork Forest Recovery Project](https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=64028) by writing the [NEPA Climate Report](https://www.regulations.gov/document/CEQ-2022-0005-0023). I also worked on international efforts to improve climate change monitoring, as well as product development for a few climate tech startups.

**My Background**

I received a PhD in Atmospheric Science from the University of Utah, my MS in Atmospheric Physics from the University of Nevada, Reno, and a BS in Geophysics and Atmospheric Science from the University of California, Davis. In over 7 years of research experience I tackled problems in climate science, atmospheric physics, mechanical engineering, geology, machine learning, and remote sensing.
