I am a Climate Scientist and Climate Adaptation Consultant. I earned a PhD in Atmospheric Science from the University of Utah, with research on improving climate change forecasts to be more precise. As a consultant, I use climate modeling to help government agencies and nonprofits ensure projects are resilient to climate change while navigating complex planning requirements including the new NEPA climate analysis. I also advise and consult for startups on climate science and climate modeling opportunities.

**My Research**

My research uses atmospheric science, physics, machine learning, and economics to create better climate forecasts. Typically, climate forecasters either present the full range of model predictions, or focus on the worst simulation out of hundreds. As climate impacts become more severe, accurate and narrow projections are needed to improve resilience, which remains difficult with current climate tools. While the ultimate solution is an overhaul of climate models, in my publications I argue for a simpler fix in the meantime, using economic forecasts and satellite data to show which forecasts are more likely, producing a much narrower range of climate changes which adaptation features can focus on. 

**Consulting Services**

As a Climate Scientist, I can assist on a variety of projects where climate forecasts are necessary, and assist with greenhouse gas accounting, sustainability, or other climate-related issues. In the past, I have worked on a few large forest restoration projects such as the [North Fork Forest Recovery Project] (https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=64028) by writing the [NEPA Climate Report] (https://www.regulations.gov/document/CEQ-2022-0005-0023). I have also worked on international efforts to improve climate change monitoring, as well as product development for various startups.
