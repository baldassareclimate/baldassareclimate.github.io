I bring scientific rigor, creativity, and cutting-edge climate science knowledge to multidisciplinary problems. I can assist on a variety of projects requiring climate modeling, greenhouse gas accounting, sustainability analysis or recommendations, and other climate-related issues. I thrive working on complex challenges with minimal guidance and poorly defined requirements. My expertise in regulatory compliance (NEPA etc.), climate modeling for adaptation, and technical writing allows your organization to focus on its strengths, with the knowledge that the climate analysis is covered.

I offer affordable, fast, and high-quality report writing, climate change analysis, and greenhouse gas accounting services, tailored to your needs. I also help companies from startups to international consortiums analyze business opportunities involving climate change, providing detailed, actionable reports. Past clients have been impressed by my rigorousness, versatility, and creativity in meeting their complex challenges.
