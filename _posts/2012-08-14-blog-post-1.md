My paper "A Simple Framework for Likely Climate Projections Applied to Tropical Width" which outlines a better way to forecast climate change has just been published in Climate Dynamics! This is the first study to lay out a rigorous method for modeling climate change using CMIP6 models, allowing for far more precise projections of climate change.

The paper also compares climate model assumptions to independent estimates from multiple high-quality sources, showing that many climate simulations do not use reasonable assumptions. Focusing on only the best climate simulations creates the precise and reliable forecasts of climate change needed for adaptation, as shown here for changes in tropical width.
